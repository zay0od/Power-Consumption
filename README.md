# üöÄ Reducing Electrical Power Consumption using AI - Web App

üèÜ Winner of 1st place at Dubai GITEX Hackathon!

‚ö°Ô∏è Our app, designed for Hackmasters, analyzes electrical power consumption data and displays it on an intuitive web UI.

üåê Utilizing the OpenAI ChatGPT API and VueJS Framework, We developed an intelligent solution to minimize power usage and enhance energy efficiency. In just 8 hours at the hackathon, We created a web application showcasing household power consumption data, integrating the ChatGPT API for analysis and presentation.

    cd Power-Consumption
    ```

2. Using `npm` to install dependencies
  
    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

3. Create the `.env` file to store your OpenAI API key and Orgnaization ID

    ```shell
    touch .env
    ```

4. Add your OpenAI API key and Orgnaization ID to the `.env` file

    ```shell
    # Example
    VITE_OPEN_API_KEY=xxxxxxxx
    VITE_ORG_ID=org-xxxxxxx
    ```

5. Run the development server, and open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser

    ```shell
    npm run dev
